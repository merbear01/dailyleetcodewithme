1. **Greater and Less Arrays:**
    - We create two arrays, `greater` and `less`, both initialized with zeros. These arrays will keep track of the count of elements greater and less than the current element, respectively.
    - For each element in the `rating` list, we iterate through all previous elements to compare their values with the current element.

2. **Nested Loops:**
    - The outer loop iterates over the indices `i` from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `rating` list.
    - The inner loop iterates over the indices `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
    - For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, we compare the values of `rating[i]` and `rating[j]`.

3. **Conditions:**
    - If `rating[i] > rating[j]`, it means the current element is greater than the previous element at index `j`.
        - We increment `greater[i]` (the count of elements greater than `rating[i]`).
        - We also add the count of valid teams formed using the previous element at index `j` to the overall `count`.
    - If `rating[i] < rating[j]`, it means the current element is less than the previous element at index `j`.
        - We increment `less[i]` (the count of elements less than `rating[i]`).
        - Again, we add the count of valid teams formed using the previous element at index `j` to the overall `count`.

4. **Counting Valid Teams:**
    - The valid teams are those where either:
        - `rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]` (increasing order), or
        - `rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]` (decreasing order).
    - By keeping track of the counts of greater and less elements, we can efficiently calculate the number of valid teams that can be formed using the current element.

The key idea is to avoid unnecessary iterations by maintaining the `greater` and `less` arrays. This approach reduces the time complexity from $$O(n^3)$$ to $$O(n^2)$$, making it more efficient. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarification! ðŸ˜Šâ€‹
