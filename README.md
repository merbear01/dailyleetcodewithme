## Introduction

This repository is created to encourage consistent practice of coding problems from LeetCode. By solving a problem daily, you can improve your coding skills, gain a deeper understanding of algorithms, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Getting Started

To get started with solving problems in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/merbear01/dailyleetcodewithme.git
    cd dailyleetcodewithme
    ```

2. **Install necessary dependencies**:
    - Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version: 3.8 or higher).
    - You may also need to install other libraries, which will be specified in the individual problem directories.

3. **Navigate to the problem folder**:
    ```bash
    cd problems/ProblemName
    ```

## How to Use

Each problem will have its own directory containing the following files:

- **Problem description** (`README.md`): Describes the problem, including the input and output format.
- **Solution** (`solution.py`): Contains the Python code for the solution.

## Daily Problem Solving

1. **Check the daily problem**: Visit the `problems` directory to find the problem for the day.
2. **Read the problem description**: Understand the problem requirements and constraints.
3. **Implement the solution**: Write your code in the `solution.py` file.
